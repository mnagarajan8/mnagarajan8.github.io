						<h1>CS7641 Project Proposal (Indicators of Heart Disease)</h1>
				      <h2>Introduction, Background, and Dataset</h2>
					<p>Heart disease is currently the number 1 cause of death in the United States causing nearly 700,000 deaths per year. It is largely related to the person(s) current health conditions, as a result we will use machine learning models to identify leading factors resulting in patients’ deaths. Our dataset accounts for leading factors like BMI, smoking history, and sex which are currently identified as factors leading to heart disease.</p>
					      <p>The dataset we are using comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents.</p>

				<h2>Methods</h2>
				  <li>Preprocessing</li>
				  <ul>
				    <li>We will start by partitioning our dataset such that 90% of our data points will be used as training data and 10% as test data. We will convert all of our features that are binary from ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to 1’s and 0’s respectively, and all categorical data such as age ranges will be processed into integer equivalents (i.e. 50-54 = 0, 55-59 = 1, etc.) From there we will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of features.</li>
				  <li>Unsupervised</li>
				     </ul>
				  <ul>
				    <li>We plan to analyze our data by first using the K-means algorithm. After receiving cluster assignments we will determine the cluster strength of each component through distortion value. We will analyze this metric using the elbow method to receive the optimal cluster count (k). We will then move on to using more complicated algorithms like GMM and DBScan with SMOTE in the case our data is unbalanced.</li>
				     </ul>
				  <li>Supervised</li>
				  <ul>
				    <li>We will first use Decision Tree classifiers and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to compare test results of predicting heart disease with our other models by tuning various hyperparameters. We will then move on to SVM with XGBoost as this is prominent in some research papers.
			</li>
				    </ul>

			      <h2>Potential Results and Discussion</h2>
			      <li>Unsupervised</li>
				  <ul>
				    <li>We expect the unsupervised models to produce clusters that we may examine to discover commonalities. We anticipate finding clusters of cases of heart disease that are related (e.g., share BMI or Mental Health), as well as other clusters that are less visible and call for more investigation. We want to utilize PCA to reduce the number of dimensions and only take into account the most important features.</li>
			      </ul>
			      <li>Supervised</li>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Our supervised models are expected to be trained to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on a set of features such as age and smoking status to identify which features are the most important predictors of heart disease.
			</li>
			      </ul>

			<h1>CS7641 Project Midterm Report (Indicators of Heart Disease)</h1>
			
			<h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
			<p>Heart disease is currently the number 1 cause of death in the United States causing nearly 700,000 deaths per year. It is largely related to the person(s) current health conditions, as a result we will use machine learning models to identify leading factors resulting in positive diagnoses and also see if we can accurately predict subpopulations that either have or are privy to developing heart disease.</p>
			<p>Much work has been done in this areas using various techniques on various datasets containing data on various potential heart disease factors. Rati Goel, for example, used 6 different algorithms on a dataset with data on things such as cholesterol and blood pressure[1].</p>
			
			<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
			<p>Identifying the types of people that are likely to have heart disease and the primary factors can be valuable in developing treatments and in early detection so that we can better monitor the health of those at risk. We hope to add onto the body of work that already exists in this specific field of research.</p>
		
			<h2>Dataset</h2>
			<h3>About the Dataset</h3>
			<p>The dataset we are using comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. This dataset accounts for leading factors like BMI, smoking history, and sex which are currently identified as factors leading to heart disease.The following is a sample of raw data from the dataset:<\p>

			<h3>Data Cleaning/Pre-processing</h3>
			<p>Overall, this particular dataset had great usability, with no null entries/missing data. Therefore, we did not have to deal with this issue. We had to perform the following on the dataset for cleaning:</p>
				<li>Remove Duplicate Columns</li>
				<ul>
					<li>As a result, 18078 rows were dropped</li>
				</ul>
			<p>For pre-processing, by looking at the data we can see there are a lot of categorical features. To solve this issue we created our own defined mappings along with sklearn’s LabelEncoder. The same snippet of raw data now looks like:</p>

			<h2>Post-processing Visualizations</h2>
			<p>Following the cleaning techniques used, we made visuals to gain insight into the distribution of all the features.</p>
